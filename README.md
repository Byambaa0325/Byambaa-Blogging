# 2020 Summer Goal: Start Blogging!

This is a repository for my blog. The blog itself is based on fast-ai's template, which has one of my most favourite Deep Learning MOOC.

I plan to blog on following topics:
- Reinforement Learning / Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Graph Representation Learning
- Neural Combinatorial Optimization
- Deep Learning and Machine Learning in general
- Coding and Algorithms
- Math, Probability, and Statics etc
- Other stuffs I occasionally read like mindfulness, productivity, philosophy, and MOOCs!

While it already sounds like a stretch for a single summer, I'll try-- at least.
